# python_visualization_co2_gdp
This is a Data ANalytics visualization project. I have used pandas, numpy, panel and hvplot to build this project. I have added a screen-shot of my project. 
If you don't have time to run the code, you can just open the co2_gdp.jpg file to get an idea what I have done in the project.
